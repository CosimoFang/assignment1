I compile my code on Windows11 using Visual Studio Code

Instructions for running your executables.


If you want to redo the test, just run:
```
imgDisplay.exe {image_path}
vidDisplay.exe
```
(In case that the exe cannot be run correctly, I add some required opencv lib on the same directory)

No extension modules

No time travel days
