# assignment1

### Dear professor, I want to ask for three days of time travel, since I got an important interview this Friday. 

### I cannot resubmit on Gradescope after the deadline, so please check and grade this repo: https://github.com/CosimoFang/assignment1 after three days. Thanks again for the flexibility

I compile my code on Windows using Visual Studio Code

Instructions for running your executables.
If you want to redo the test, just run:
```
imgDisplay.cpp
vidDisplay.cpp
```
I add the extension function for user to save the modified images.
